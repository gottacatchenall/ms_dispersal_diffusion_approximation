# Introduction

Human activity is rapidly altering our planet, leaving Earth's habitats
fragmented and patchy. This change has had profoundly altered Earth's
ecosystems, their functioning, and the services they provide to humans, and
understanding the consequences of land-use and climate change on ecological
processes remains a fundamental goal of ecological research. It us well
understood that landscape structure influences ecosystem processes [@cite] and
that promoting landscape connectivity can mitigate the negative effects of
habitat loss on ecosystem functioning [@resascoMetaanalysisDecadeTesting2019].
As a result understanding how habitat structure effects the movement and
dispersal of organisms, and how this scales up to explain the abundance and
distribution of species across space, is a primary aim of landscape ecology.
Models in landscape ecology---analytic, computational, and statistical--- have
long used diffusion to approximate model how organisms move or disperse between
habitat patches. What does it mean that model uses diffusion? The way in which
organisms move from one habitat patch to another, via active or passive
dispersal, is inherently stochastic. Diffusion approximates this stochastic
process by assuming the that stochastic process of movement of organisms between
two locations is equal to its expected value at every time point---ignoring any
temporal variation in dispersal. However, here we show that in some cases this
assumption creates artificially synchronized dynamics across space.

Why is it important we understand when dispersal is a valid approx of dispersal?
In order to design landscapes that mitigate biodiversity loss and its effects
[@albertApplyingNetworkTheory2017], we need models to understand how landscape
structure affects ecological processes. Understanding when dispersal is
well-approximated by diffusion, and when it isn't, is important because
diffusion models are much less computationally expensive.

We do this by using a simulation model with two parts: 1) a spatial graph model
of both stochastic dispersal and diffusion, and 2) a Ricker model of local
population dynamics. We then show that there are two regimes: one under which
diffusion creates highly synchronized dynamics where stochastic dispersal
doesn't, and one under which diffusion and stochastic dispersal produce similar
distributions of synchrony. We show that the boundaries between these regimes is
caused by both the modularity of the dispersal network and demographic
parameters.
